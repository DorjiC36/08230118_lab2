        Hello! I am <strong>Dorji Choden</strong>, a 19 year old ethusiatic learner. I am pursuing my bachelor's degree of education in IT field at <strong>Samtse College of Education </strong>, and currently in my third year. I am determined person and a passionate one who loves to explore technologies around the world. Apart from coding, I am intrested in drawing and sketching. During my leisure time, I choose to spend it by listening to music and sketch anything as it helps me to stay calm and relieve myself from stress.
